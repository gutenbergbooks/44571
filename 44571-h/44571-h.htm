<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>It will be readily perceived that the literary part of this
work is of humble pretensions. One object alone has
been aimed at and it is hoped with success&mdash;to select
or to invent those incidents which might be interesting
or amusing in themselves, while they afforded scope for
the peculiar talents of the artist who adorns them with
his designs. The selection was more difficult than may
at first sight be supposed. It is true, there is no paucity
of subjects of wit and humour, but he who will
take the trouble to examine them, will find how few are
adapted for pictorial representation. No artist can embody
a point of wit, and the humour of many of the
most laughable stories would vanish at the touch of the
pencil of the most ingenious designer in the world.
Those ludicrous subjects only which are rich in the humour
of <i>situation</i> are calculated for graphic illustration.
To prove the following anecdotes are not deficient
in this respect, no other appeal is necessary than
to the plates themselves. Look at the breadth of the
humour, the point of the situation, the selection of the
figures, the action, and its accompaniments, and deny
(without a laugh on the face) that this portion of the
work answers the end in view. In all this the writer or
compiler, or whatever he may be called, claims little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
merit. That the whole effect is comic, that the persons
are ludicrous, and engaged in laughable groups and surrounded
with objects which tend to broaden the grin,
all this, and a thousand times more, belongs to Mr.
Cruikshank;&mdash;the writer only claims the merit of
having suggested to him the materials.</p>

<p>Some of the <span class="smcap">ten points</span>, now submitted to the public,
arise out of a reprint of that admirable piece of
humour, the <span class="smcap">Jolly Beggars</span> of Burns;&mdash;A part of his
works almost unknown to the public, in consequence
of the scrupulousness of the poet's biographer and
editor, who withheld them from the world. Lest we
however should incur the charge, which Dr. Currie apprehended,
we beg leave to prefix the observations on
this subject by the first literary character in the kingdom,
Sir Walter Scott, as they appeared in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>.</p>

<p>"Yet applauding, as we do most highly applaud, the
leading principles of Dr. Currie's selection, we are
aware that they sometimes led him into fastidious and
over-delicate rejection of the bard's most spirited and
happy effusions. A thin octavo, published at Glasgow
in 1801, under the title of 'Poems ascribed to Robert
Burns, the Ayrshire bard,' furnishes valuable proofs of
this assertion; it contains, among a good deal of rubbish,
some of his most brilliant poetry. A cantata, in
particular, called <i>The Jolly Beggars</i>, for humorous description
and nice discrimination of character, is inferior
to no poem of the same length in the whole range of
English poetry. The scene, indeed, is laid in the very
lowest department of low life, the actors being a set
of strolling vagrants, met to carouse, and barter their
rags and plunder for liquor in a hedge ale-house. Yet
even in describing the movements of such a group, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
native taste of the poet has never suffered his pen to
slide into any thing coarse or disgusting. The extravagant
glee and outrageous frolic of the beggars are
ridiculously contrasted with their maimed limbs, rags,
and crutches&mdash;the sordid and squalid circumstances
of their appearance are judiciously thrown into the
shade. Nor is the art of the poet less conspicuous in
the individual figures, than in the general mass. The
festive vagrants are distinguished from each other by
personal appearance and character, as much as any
fortuitous assembly in the higher orders of life. The
group, it must be observed, is of Scottish character,
and doubtless our northern brethren are more familiar
with its varieties than we are; yet the distinctions are
too well marked to escape even the southern. The most
prominent persons are a maimed soldier and his female
companion, a hackneyed follower of the camp, a stroller,
late the consort of an highland ketterer, or sturdy beggar&mdash;'but
weary fa' the waefu' woodie!'&mdash;Being now
at liberty, she becomes an object of rivalry between a
'pigmy scraper with his fiddle' and a strolling tinker.
The latter, a desperate bandit, like most of his profession,
terrifies the musician out of the field, and is preferred
by the damsel of course. A wandering ballad-singer,
with a brace of doxies, is last introduced upon
the stage. Each of these mendicants sings a song in
character, and such a collection of humorous lyrics,
connected by vivid poetical description, is not perhaps
to be paralleled in the English language. The ditty
chaunted by the Ballad Singer is certainly far superior
to any thing in the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>, where alone we
could expect to find its parallel.</p>

<p>"We are at a loss to conceive any good reason why
Dr. Currie did not introduce this singular and humorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
cantata into his collection. It is true, that in one
or two passages the muse has trespassed slightly upon
decorum, where, in the language of Scottish song,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"High kilted was she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"As she gaed owre the lea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Something, however, is to be allowed to the nature
of the subject, and something to the education of the
poet: and if from veneration to the names of Swift
and Dryden, we tolerate the grossness of the one, and
the indelicacy of the other, the respect due to that
of Burns, may surely claim indulgence for a few light
strokes of broad humour.</p>

<p>"Knowing that this, and hoping that other compositions
of similar spirit and tenor, might yet be recovered,
we were induced to think that some of them, at least,
had found a place in the collection given to the public
by Mr. Cromek. But he has neither risqued the censure,
nor gained the applause, which might have belonged
to such an undertaking."</p>

<h2><a name="POINT_I" id="POINT_I">POINT I.</a></h2>

<h3>THE POINT OF HONOUR.</h3>


<p>When the American army was at Valley Forge in
the winter of 1777, a captain of the Virginian Line
refused a challenge sent him by a brother officer, alleging
that his life was devoted to the service of his
country, and that he did not think it a point of duty to
risk it to gratify the caprice of any man. This <i>point of
duty</i> gave occasion to a <i>point of humour</i> which clearly
displayed the brilliant <i>points</i> of the officer's character,
and exposed the weak ones of his brothers in the service
in a very <i>pointed</i> manner. His antagonist gave
him the character of a coward through the whole army.
Conscious of not having merited the aspersion, and
discovering the injury he should sustain in the
minds of those unacquainted with him, he repaired
one evening to a general meeting of the officers of
that line. On his entrance, he was avoided by the
company, and the officer who had challenged him,
insolently ordered him to leave the room; a request
which was loudly re-echoed from all parts. He refused,
and asserted that he came there to vindicate his fame;
and after mentioning the reasons which induced him
not to accept the challenge, he applied a large hand
grenade to the candle, and when the fuse had caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
fire, threw it on the floor, saying, "Here, gentlemen, this
will quickly determine which of us all dare brave
danger most." At first they stared upon him for a
moment in stupid astonishment, but their eyes soon fell
upon the fuse of the grenade, which was fast burning
down. Away scampered Colonel, General, Ensign, and
Captain, and all made a rush at the door. "Devil
take the hindmost." Some fell, and others made way
over the bodies of their comrades; some succeeded in
getting out, but for an instant there was a general heap
of flesh sprawling at the entrance of the apartment.
Here was a colonel jostling with a subaltern, and there
fat generals pressing lean lieutenants into the boards,
and blustering majors, and squeaking ensigns wrestling
for exit; the size of one and the feebleness of the other
making their chance of departure pretty equal, until
time, which does all things at last, cleared the room and
left the noble captain standing over the grenade with
his arms folded, and his countenance expressing every
kind of scorn and contempt for the train of scrambling
red coats, as they toiled and bustled and bored their
way out of the door.</p>

<p>After the explosion had taken place, some of them ventured
to return, to take a peep at the mangled remains
of their comrade, whom however to their great surprise
they found alive and uninjured.&mdash;When they were all
gone, the captain threw himself flat on the floor as the
only possible means of escape, and fortunately came off
with a whole skin, and a repaired reputation.</p>

<h3>THE SHORT COURTSHIP.</h3>

   <a name="i_015" id="i_015"></a>
   <img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="Old man and woman in bed" title="Old man and woman in bed" />
</div>

<p>As a gentleman was passing along one of the more retired
streets of London late in the evening, he stumbled
over the body of an old man, whom on examination he
found in a state of excessive inebriation, and who had
in consequence tumbled down and rolled into the
kennel. He had not gone many yards farther when he
found an old woman very nearly in the same circumstances.
It immediately struck Mr. L. that this was some poor
old couple, who, overcome with the fatigues of the day,
had indulged too freely in some restorative beverage,
whether Hodges' or Deady's the historian does not say.
Full of this idea, and animated by his own charitable
disposition, Mr. L. soon made arrangements for the
reception of the poor couple into a neighbouring public
house, where the landlord promised that the senseless
pair should be undressed and placed in a warm and
comfortable bed. To bed they were put. Mr. L. left
them lying side by side, snoring in concert, and likely
to pass together a more harmonious night than perhaps
would have been the case had they possessed the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
enjoyment of their senses. L. journeyed homewards filled
with the satisfaction arising from the performance of a
kind deed, and never reflected that there was a possibility
of his having joined a pair whom the laws of God had not
made one. The fact was, that the old man and the old
woman were perfect strangers to each other, and their
being found in a similar situation was purely accidental.
In London, however extraordinary it may appear, many
poor folks get drunk at night, especially Saturday night,
and what is not less wonderful, they are in this state
often unable to preserve their balance&mdash;the laws of gravity
exert their influence, and the patient rolls into the
kennel. Soundly&mdash;soundly did this late united pair
sleep and snore till morning,&mdash;when the light broke in
upon them and disclosed the secret.&mdash;Imagine the consternation
of the old lady when the fumes of intoxication
were dissipated, and she opened her eyes upon her snoring
partner&mdash;where she was or how she had been put there
she knew not. It was clear she was in bed with a man,
and that was an event which had never happened to her
before,&mdash;so she set up a scream, and roused the old
gentleman, whose astonishment was not a jot less than
the lady's. She sat upon end in bed staring at him,
he moved himself into a similar situation and riveted
his eyes upon her, and so they remained for a few instants
both full of perfect wonderment;&mdash;at last it struck
the poor lady that this was some monster of a man who
had succeeded in some horrible design upon her honour;
the idea in a moment gave her the look and manner of a
fury, she flung out of bed and roared aloud to the admiration
of all the inmates of the house, who attracted by
her first scream were already peeping in at the door of
the room,&mdash;"make me an honest woman, thou wretch,"
she cried&mdash;"villain that you are,&mdash;make an honest woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of me, or I'll be the death of thee;"&mdash;down she sat
upon the bed-stocks, and as she attempted to dress herself
she interlarded her occupation with calling for vengeance
upon her horrible seducer, who sat trembling at
the other side of the bed, vainly attempting in his fright
to insinuate his legs into his old tattered breeches. The
landlord at last interfered with the authority of his station,
and on inquiry found that no breach had been
made which could not be easily repaired. The old
gentleman was asked if he had any objection to take
his fair bedfellow for a helpmate during the remainder
of his life; he stammered out his acquiescence as well
as he could, and the enraged virgin consented to smooth
down her anger on satisfaction being made to her
injured honour. The bargain was soon struck, the
happy pair were bundled off to church, amidst the laughing
shouts of the mob, where a parson waited to make
good the match too precipitately formed by our charitable
friend.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, was so remarkably
fond of children, that he suffered the sons of the
Prince Royal to enter his apartment whenever they
thought proper. One day, while he was writing in his
closet, the eldest of these princes was playing at shuttlecock
near him. The shuttlecock happened to fall
upon the table at which the King sat, who threw it at
the young prince and continued to write. The shuttlecock
falling on the table a second time, the King threw
it back, looking sternly at the child, who promised that
no accident of the kind should happen again; the
shuttlecock however fell a third time and even upon the
paper on which the king was writing. Frederick then
took the shuttlecock and put it in his pocket: the little
prince humbly asked pardon and begged the King to
return him his shuttlecock. His Majesty refused: the
prince redoubled his entreaties, but no attention was
paid to them; the young prince at length being tired of
begging, advanced boldly towards the King, put his
two hands on his side, and tossing back his little head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
with great haughtiness, said in a threatening tone, "Will
your Majesty give me my shuttlecock, Yes or No?"
The King burst into a fit of laughter, and taking the
shuttlecock out of his pocket, returned it to the prince
saying, "you are a brave boy, <i>you</i> will never suffer
Silesia to be taken from you."</p>

<h3>EXCHANGE NO ROBBERY.</h3>


<p>Near Taunton, in Somersetshire, lived a sturdy fellow,
by trade a miller, who possessed a handsome and
buxom young woman for his wife. The said dame was
many years the junior of her spouse, and thought that
the neighbouring village contained not a few more
agreeable companions, than the one whom Heaven had
given her for life. Of this circumstance the miller had
some suspicions, and determined to set them at rest one
way or the other. Accordingly, one day he pretended
to set off to buy corn, and told his wife that he should
not be at home that night. The miller departed, and
when the shades of evening afforded some concealment,
in glided, to supply his place at bed and board, a neighbouring
country squire.</p>

<p>As the village clock struck one that night, and as
the loving pair were wrapped in sleep, a loud knocking
was heard at the door.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_025" id="i_025"></a>
   <img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="Man dining while wife laments" title="Man dining while wife laments" />
</div>

<p>The miller had unexpectedly returned home, and the
unfortunate couple within were reduced to despair. The
wit of the female was however equal to the emergency;
the gentleman's clothes were pushed under her own, and
his person was conducted into the kitchen, by the frail
fair one, and there enclosed in a singular place of security.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
The tall house clock, which always forms a part of the
furniture of the "parlour, kitchen, and all," of men of
our miller's rank, was at that time out of order, and
the works had, on the very morning in question, been
conveyed to Taunton, to undergo a thorough repair.
It immediately struck the damsel that her lover could
abide in no safer place than this, until her husband was
asleep, and she could return and let him out. Now
the country squire was a tall and a stout man, with a
jolly rubicund physiognomy. He consequently enclosed
himself in the clock-case with some difficulty, and
when the good woman locked the door of it, as the
only way of keeping it shut, it gave him a nip in the
paunch, which would have extorted a cry under any
other circumstances. As it was, the tightness below
threw all the blood into his countenance, which, for
such was his height, overtopped the wood work of
the case, and appeared exactly at the spot where the
clock usually shewed the hour. So that, had a light
been held up to it, this portentous face would have
borne the appearance of a dark red moon scowling out
of fog and vapours upon a stormy night. This despatched,
the dame commenced her own part with confidence.
She gaped and yawned, and only admitted
the miller till he had cursed and sworn his wife into a
conviction, that he was her lawful husband, and no deceiver
who had mimicked his voice and manner for his
own wicked purposes. Much to the dismay of the
parties already in possession of the house, the miller
insisted upon striking a light, which at length obtaining,
he drove his wife before him up to the bed-room,
and then slily and under pretence of something else,
examined the apartment; and concluded with a thorough
conviction of the groundlessness of his suspicions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
The wife, overjoyed at getting the candle out of the
kitchen without discovery, was in high good humour,
so that the miller became in excellent spirits too, both
on account of his agreeable reception and the dispersion
of his fears, and as a proof of his state of mind
gave his wife a hearty kiss, and swore that they would
go down and have a cozy bit of supper together before
they went to bed. In vain the poor woman resisted,
the slice of bacon must be broiled and the eggs poached.
With trembling hand she bore the light into the
kitchen, and durst not cast a glance upon the clock case
where the prisoner, full of horror at the return of the
candle, and reduced to a state of insufferable impatience
by his miserable plight, uttered a deep low groan
of despair as they entered the apartment. Fortunately
it was not loud enough to attract the miller's attention,
but thrilled through the heart of his unfortunate spouse.
The happy pair soon began their culinary operations, the
male with a light heart and a hungry appetite, the female
sick and trembling at the disclosure which she
feared was inevitable. All she could do, she did. She
tried to keep up a conversation, she shaded the light,
and she spread rasher after rasher before the all-devouring
miller, who seemed as if intent to display his
prowess before his rival, who was most ruefully and
intently gazing upon him from his window of observation.
By the lady's artful management, the miller sat
with only a side view of the clock, and allowed a few
sympathizing glances to be interchanged between the
unhappy squire and his love, as she spread the tempting
meal before her liege lord. Doubtless they both
thought the miller's appetite was enormous, and in the
calculation of either of them, he had already eat a side
of bacon, when he declared he had done. <i>Now for</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<i>good luck!</i> inwardly exclaimed the dame, <i>fortune befriend
me, and let me get him up stairs without casting a look upon
that poor deplorable face</i>; which by the bye had lately been
assuming all hues, and within the last two minutes had
turned from a blue red to deadly pale, and back again
to red black; and slight twitches and convulsive motions
were observed in the muscles of his face, as if the poor
unfortunate owner of them was tormented by some body
below, who alternately pricked and pinched him. Oh,
what a weight was taken off the heart of the frail fair one,
and how fervently did she offer up vows of chastity in
the gratitude of the moment, when the miller, having eat
and drank his fill, made a motion for the bed room.
Gladly was she attending him, when, as ill luck would
have it, a <i>loud sneeze</i> was heard in the room, which was
followed by an equally loud scream from the lady of
the miller, who now gave all up for lost. It seemed
that the dust of the clock-case had been disturbed by
the body of the squire, and part of it being dislodged,
had sought refuge in the intricacies of his nostrils.
Hence the wincings and writhings, which, over and
above being abominably nipped, produced the awful
changes recorded above, and at length ended in a
sneeze, which he could no longer restrain. This event
had not the expected issue, for the dame in her fright
threw down the candlestick, which she held in her hand,
and extinguished the light. The good miller, now
drowsy and stupid, chid her for being alarmed at the
sneezing of a <i>cat</i>; and, not waiting for the poking out
of a light from the dying embers, pushed his wife and
himself off to bed, bestowing upon her, by the way, many
of those endearing caresses, which husbands in a good
humour lavish upon their wives; which caresses were
certainly as indifferent to her, as they were doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
disagreeable to her friend in the clock. Release was not
so soon at hand as the parties sanguinely expected, for
though the miller slept, he took as secure a hold of his
faithful dame, as if he had really been aware of the gaol-delivery
she intended to accomplish. To her last resource,
therefore, she was compelled to fly, for the
morning was fast coming on. The miller's sleep was
broken by the loud cries of his wife, who declared she
was so ill, she was sure she should die. She yelled and
screamed till the poor man in despair knew not what
to do, and could only cry out <i>What can I get you, What
can I get you?</i> Now the wily dame well knew that <i>that</i>
would be the best for her complaint which was not in
the house, so she vociferated <i>Brandy, brandy, Oh for
some brandy.</i> The poor husband scrambled up some
clothes, and set off for the nearest public house for some
brandy, which was nearly a mile from his abode. Arriving
there, he knocked up the landlord, who administered
the medicine to him. To pay for which, the distressed
husband put his hand in his breeches' pocket, and much
to his own surprise, pulled out a large bundle of bank
notes, at which he stared in amazement; when the landlord
cried out, Lord! <i>you have got Mr. Farrer's breeches
on</i>. Buckskins, it seems, well known in the neighbourhood.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>The Devil I have</i>," returned the miller, in a tone
which came up like a groan, as he gazed upon his nether
man. Quickly comprehending the secret of the exchange,
he pocketed the notes, drank up the brandy
for his own consolation, and went home, moralizing his
pensive path, and gave the hypocritical culprit the
soundest beating she ever had in her life. She, poor
soul! who had been charitably employed in the meanwhile,
in letting the bird out of his cage, was not prepared
for this reception; nor did she understand it until
the next morning, when the breeches were cried round
the town by her malignant husband, who also with no
pleasant expression of countenance, made a point of
turning over his newly-acquired riches in her presence.</p>

<h2><a name="POINT_IX" id="POINT_IX">POINT IX.</a></h2>

<h3>THE DOWNFALL OF HOLY CHURCH.</h3>


<p>In the year of 1460, Revel was governed by a General,
whose name was John of Mengden; a worthy old man,
who loved his glass of wine, and had the gout; for
wine and the gout are sister's children. It was his
custom to ride out occasionally on a black horse down
to the shores of the Baltic, whence he continued his
way to a convent of nuns consecrated to St. Bridget.
This nunnery, which was called Marianthal, was
situated about a mile from the town, and its ruins are
inhabited by owls and ravens.</p>

<p>On one of these excursions he was accompanied by
the Lord Marshal, Gothard of Plettenberg.</p>

<p>As they approached the convent wall, the Marshal's
horse became suddenly restive. "Have you heard,"
said he, "the strange stories of the subterraneous passage,
and that it winds in intricate mazes round the
cloister?"&mdash;&mdash;"No;" replied John of Mengden, "but
I should like to hear them over a bottle; you shall relate
them to me in the evening." "It may be done
now, and in a few words," rejoined the other; "for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
stand exactly before the subterraneous passage, or
mouth of the cavern; but for fifty years, not a human
foot has advanced beyond the bottom of the steps,
there the torches are always blown out."</p>

<p>The burgomaster of Revel, who was then with them,
made a cross on his breast, and confirmed the statement.
"Sometimes," continued Gothard, "are heard,
during the night, the sounds of soft music, arising
slowly and melodiously from the cave, like the sweet
tones of musical glasses, with an accompaniment of the
songs of angels. The holy sisters of the convent are
frequent listeners to this divine harmony, though none
of the words can be understood." "Let the venerable
Lady Abbess come down to me," said the general, as
he alighted from his horse, and placed his glove in his
sword-belt. The Abbess now appeared, veiled. She
modestly curtsied to the knight, and presented him
with a cup of Spanish wine. The old General laid himself
down on the grass, and asked the sainted lady if
she could give him any information relative to the subterraneous
passage? The Abbess replied in the affirmative,
adding a number of particulars concerning what
she and her pious sisters had seen,&mdash;and fancied they
had seen&mdash;heard, and fancied they had heard.</p>

<p>"So God and St. Vitus help me!" exclaimed the
governor, "I will myself make an attempt to descend
into the cavern; give me a lighted, consecrated torch."</p>

<p>The burgomaster crossed himself all over. A cold
shivering seized him; the only vault into which he had
been accustomed to descend, was the town-cellar, which
was haunted by none but <i>choice spirits</i>, with which he
was familiar.</p>

<p>The lady Abbess entreated the old man not to undertake
so rash an enterprize; and assured him, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
spirits of former times, unlike those of the present day,
would not allow themselves to be sported with. But
in arguing with the brave old General, they talked to
the wind which blew over the Baltic. The consecrated
torches were brought, the corpulent General repeated
an Ave-Maria, recommended himself to St. Vitus, his
protecting Saint, and courageously entered the mysterious
passage. The sound of his feet was still heard
on the steps; his breathing was still audible, and the
glimmer of his torch played on the damp walls. On a
sudden all was silent, and the light disappeared. The
listeners above were on the stretch of attention. Gothard
was stationed on the upper step; the burgomaster
a few paces further back; and behind him stood the
Abbess, her rosary running through her fingers. They
listened, but all was still! "Holloa there, John of
Mengden!&mdash;how fare you?" thundered the voice of
Gothard; yet all was still as the grave. The listeners
were alarmed; they inclined their ears; they stood
lightly on tip-toe; they restrained their breath&mdash;not a
sound ascended. The cavern yawned before them, and
all was silent below; "Holy St. Bridget! what can have
happened? Let the priests be summoned, and mass be
said, to appease the spirits!"</p>

<p>The lady Abbess hastened to the convent, rang the
chapel-bell, when all the pious sisterhood hurried from
their cells, fell upon their bare knees, chastizing themselves,
and praying to heaven for mercy towards the old
General. The burgomaster threw himself upon his
horse, and trotted back to the town to impart the terrible
news to his wife, children and domestics. Gothard,
who was a courageous knight, alone remained, absorbed
in gloomy reflection, leaning against the wall, with his
eyes fixed on the darkness beneath. Thus he continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
during two hours. At last he thought he heard on
the steps some one breathing and struggling.&mdash;"John
of Mengden!" he vociferated&mdash;"are you alive, or
dead?"&mdash;"I am alive!" replied the General, half breathless,
as he stumbled up the steps. "Thanks to God
and St. Bridget!&mdash;we have been in agony on your account.
Where have you been? What have you heard
or seen?" The General then related that he had quietly
descended, with the consecrated taper in his hand;
that his heart beat a little as he advanced; that a cold
shiver had begun to seize him; but that he took courage,
as his taper burnt always clear and bright: that
at length he stood on the bottom step, and looked down
an endless passage, doubtful whether, under the protection
of St. Bridget, he should move forward or backward;
that suddenly he was surrounded by a lukewarm
breeze, mild and fragrant, as if wafted over a
bed of flowers, which in a moment extinguished his
taper, and so clouded his senses, that he sunk like a
dead man on the steps, and then lay a considerable
time in a sort of trance; that at last he awoke again,
and it appeared to him as if he were gently moved by
a warm hand, though he knew not where he was, nor
what had happened to him; that he stretched out his
hands, and felt nothing but the cold stone; but that,
as a little daylight glimmered upon him from above, he
composed his spirits, and began to creep with difficulty
up the steps; that when on them he was perfectly recovered,
feeling only a slight oppression in the head,
similar to the effect of intoxication.</p>

<p>"Well, brother," said he to the lord-marshal, "will
not you also make the attempt, and try whether it will
not succeed better with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Gothard of Plettenberg demurred: notwithstanding
he never feared, in former times, a knight of flesh and
bone, as long as he was able to wield his sword; yet,
with respect to ghosts, a very just exception was allowed;
and a knight might tremble in the dark like an old
woman, without any stain upon his honor, or impeachment
of his valour. Now a days, the matter is quite
altered, and a man may fear any thing but ghosts.</p>

<p>"By my sword," said the governor, as he was returning
home, "I will investigate the causes of this
mystery. I must know from whose mouth proceeded the
gentle breath, that smelt fragrant as the plants of the
east, and yet had force enough to extinguish the flame
of the consecrated taper, and even to confuse my head,
as though I had been drunk."</p>

<p>He instantly sent for Henry of Uxkull, bishop of
Revel, and the Abbot of Pardis. Being arrived, they
were entertained at a large oak table, and quaffed wine
from the family goblet. They listened to the fearful
story of their host, with their fat hands folded upon their
huge bellies, and shook their heads with significant
silence.</p>

<p>Having well weighed the matter, knitted their brows
and assumed an air of importance, they finally agreed
<i>that they knew not what to think of it</i>. Each then waddled
to his home and thought no more of the mysterious
cavern.</p>

<p>But it was not so with the General. He could not
rest. His fancy was on the rack, to account for the
mystery. On the next morning, he despatched letters
to the Archbishop of Riga, to a learned canon, and two
pious deans of the holy church of Riga&mdash;stating "that
a surprising incident had obliged him to have recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to their piety and wisdom, and entreating that they
would be at Revel on St. Egidius's day, to discuss in
christian humility this weighty affair."</p>

<p>They came on the appointed day: for they were
aware that the cellar of the Governor contained excellent
wine, and that his was no niggard hospitality. The
archbishop of Revel, and the Abbot of Pardis, were
likewise invited to assist, who failed not at the proper
hour to present themselves at the castle. An elegant
repast had been prepared for them, bumpers went cheerily
round to the prosperity of Holy Church, and to
the perpetual bloom of the German order of religion.</p>

<p>When their spiritual stomachs were sufficiently
gorged, the General thus addressed them: "Reverend
and pious fathers! thus and thus it happened to me
and my friend here, Gothard of Plettenberg," recounting
his story&mdash;"What is to be done to liberate the
spirits who wander and breathe in the subterraneous
passage?"</p>

<p>"They must be driven out by force," replied the
archbishop of Riga, "and the power to do this was
given to bishops from above."</p>

<p>"A wisp of hay should be steeped in holy water,"
added the canon, "with which the steps of the dark
passage should be sprinkled."</p>

<p>One of the deans advised that "the little chest with
the Egyptian hieroglyphics, which was kept as a relic
in the convent of St. Bridget, should be taken to the
cavern."</p>

<p>The other dean was of opinion that the spirits should
be allowed to continue without molestation so long as
they only wandered and breathed.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Revel was also of the same sentiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
but the Abbot of Pardis applauded this idea of
the Egyptian hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>Last of all, the old General proposed that they should
immediately ride to the beach, and employ the arms of
the church against the inhabitants of the subterraneous
passage. The wine had imparted its spirit to the holy
fathers; and they now felt courage to engage, if necessary,
even with the fiends of hell.</p>

<p>Within half an hour they were at the convent gate!</p>

<p>Three times were the consecrated torches borne
round by the archbishop, who, muttering between his
teeth, dipped the wisp into a large ewer of holy water,
and plentifully besprinkled all present. Thus spiritually
armed, they silently and cautiously approached
the entrance of the cavern. Here a question arose,
"who should go down first?" Those who were at home
were unwilling to rob the strangers of the honor of precedence.
The deans drew back, as being merely subalterns
in the church, out of respect to their bishop.
The archbishop bowed to the right learned canon, and
he bowed to the rest. The General became impatient,
and forced the archbishop down the steps. The rest
followed with beating hearts and tottering knees.</p>

</div>

<p>Each carried in his hand a consecrated taper; and
with a rosary hanging at his elbow, sprinkled the walls
with drops of holy water. The last of the procession was
the Abbot of Pardis, who, grown unwieldy by the luxurious
diet of the church, could scarcely drag his short
puffed legs after his fat and bulky paunch. The steps
too were not only small, but damp and slippery;
whence it happened, that on the second step the Abbot
lost his footing, and falling with his whole weight upon
Henry of Uxkull, they both fell upon the last dean:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
all three on the first dean; all four on the canon; all
five upon the archbishop of Riga; when the whole
troop rolled helter skelter down the steps, and plumped
to the bottom like so many sacks, there remaining
senseless! The consecrated tapers were extinguished,
and the venerable group were veiled by a sort of Egyptian
darkness. The General, who remained above,
heard the tremendous rumbling, to which succeeded a
dead silence. For two hours he listened, called on
each by name, and waited in vain for a reply. His voice
alone was returned to him in a dull and hollow echo.
The only sound which met his eager listening, was
that of the terrified bat, flitting in the depths of the
cavern; or, at intervals, the scream of the frightened
owl.</p>

<p>He was a man of uncommon courage, and he resolved
to descend once more himself, to see what was become
of his guests; but as a prelude to this perilous
expedition, he determined to enliven his natural spirits
by a draught of generous wine. As he vociferated&mdash;"a
cup of wine," to the groom who held his horse, the
word <span class="smcap">Wine</span> reached the ears of the holy men&mdash;they disentangled
themselves from each other, scrambled up,
their foreheads bedewed with the sweat of terror, and
when they had recovered themselves, they confessed
unanimously <i>that they were not able to unravel the mystery</i>.</p>

<p>Thus ended the second attempt to gain a more intimate
acquaintance with the spirits of the subterraneous
passage, and thenceforward no one was bold enough to
tread the magic ground.</p>

<h3>A VISIT WITHOUT FORM.</h3>

</div>

<p>When the Cardinal Bernis resided at Rome in the
capacity of Ambassador from France, he bore the highest
character for sanctity&mdash;yet the Cardinal was a man,
though a churchman; and churchmen are sometimes not
invulnerable to the shafts of love. A pair of speaking
black eyes like those of the Princess B., have before
now made sad havoc in the heart of the votary of celibacy.
The lady was conscious of her own charms,
but being married to the man she loved, instead of
setting them off by certain little man&#339;uvres which some
ladies perfectly understand how to put in practice, she
carefully avoided giving any encouragement to the Cardinal,
whose constant attendance upon her began to give
her some uneasiness. At length the Cardinal, finding
that his visits, attentions, <i>cadeaux</i>, and fine speeches had
no effect, determined upon seeking an opportunity of
making the lady sensible of the excess of his passion.
One morning the Princess, on returning from mass, in
her haste to avoid a violent shower of rain, tripped as
she was getting out of her carriage, and sprained her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
ancle. The Cardinal, who by his spies was informed
of every step the Princess took, had attended at mass
also; and as he was following the Princess, unobserved,
he saw the accident and ran to her assistance, raised
her into the carriage, and very humbly entreated her to
allow him the honour of seeing her safe home. His
Excellency was not to be refused consistently with
etiquette, so the poor Princess was under the necessity
of hearing all the pretty things the Ambassador had
reserved for the occasion. All his protestations and entreaties
proved fruitless, and the poor lady arrived at
the palace almost exhausted with the alarm the conversation
had caused her. She now endeavoured with
all care to avoid receiving the Cardinal's visits, but the
old gentleman's amorous plans were not to be thwarted.&mdash;He
still found means of seeing her, and again
attacked her with his vows and protestations, so that the
lady, unable to bear it any longer, determined to inform
the Prince, and related to him all the circumstances of
the affair. The Prince was enraged, and threatened
all kinds of vengeance against the lover; but however,
when the first burst of passion had a little subsided, he
said to her, "We are, my love, in a very aukward
situation, for the Cardinal being Ambassador his person
is sacred; besides we should have the whole consistory
and his holiness at their head, thundering excommunication
upon us. However, I will think of some
scheme of cooling the passion of this holy gentleman."
He accordingly suggested that she should write word
to the Cardinal, that as her husband was going that evening
to his Villa near Tivoli, to order some improvement
to be made which would detain him the best part of next
day, she had determined to admit a visit from him; but
that in order to keep the matter a secret from the servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
she desired him to come at midnight; that she
would fix a silken ladder at her room window which
looked into the garden, whence he might easily ascend
into the anti-room, where he would find the door open
that led into her own room. The reader will naturally
conceive the transports which this delicious billet
excited in the worthy Cardinal. He danced, and leaped
and capered about for joy, rang the bell, gave contradictory
orders, and convinced his valet that he was
mad. He had the sense however to direct a suit of his
finest linen to be prepared, and to countermand the
order for his carriage, for he bethought himself he had
better go privately. How tedious did the hours, which
intervened before the time of appointment, appear to
our ardent lover, and when the clock struck eleven he
could no longer wait. It was a good distance, he must
be there in time, not a second too late; therefore off he
set after taking some precautions against his sacred
person being discovered. He arrives, panting with love
and hope; the burning of Mongibello could scarcely
exceed the conflagration within him. He gets to the
garden-gate. One cannot think of every thing. The
Princess in her flurry had forgotten to order the garden-gate
to be left open. What was to be done? The wall
was not high; but must his Eminence endanger his
sacred person? Love, however, the sovereign ruler, who
makes even cowards heroes, animated him. It was
dreadfully dark; but luckily, in feeling for the height
of the wall, the anxious lover found an aperture in it
large enough to admit the foot: into this he stepped,
gave a spring, and got to the top; and then slid down
the other side, not however without losing his hat and
cloak, which owing to the darkness of the night he
could not find again, nor was he aware, for the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
reason, how he was daubed with mortar and brick-dust.
In this pickle, our Adonis made the best of his way to
find the ladder, tumbling over orange-trees and rosebushes,
to the manifest injury of his cassock, which
began to hang about him in rags. At last he reached
the ladder, seized hold of it, stopped, panted a while
for breath, and then up he went. He had just got one
leg through the window, when the two large folding
doors of the apartment flew open, and fifteen or twenty
servants with lighted torches in their hands presented
themselves before him. The Prince, at their head, ran
up to the window, and with all courtesy helped in the
astonished Cardinal, and turning to the servants said,
"Scoundrels! is it thus you pay respect to the sacred
person of the Cardinal Bernis? Is it thus, by your negligence,
that you compel his Eminence, when coming
to my wife, to venture his precious life upon a slight
ladder and force him through the window in this miserable
plight?" Conceive the situation of the bald-pated,
cloakless, and tattered Cardinal, as he stood
ashamed and terrified before the jeering Prince and his
twenty torchbearers. His trembling knees could scarcely
support him, as, half dead with fright, shame, and disappointment,
he sneaked out of the room, still lighted
by the torches and bowed out by the Prince, who continued
to apologize for the carelessness of his servants,
much to the annoyance of the poor Cardinal, whose
misery was heightened by one stroke more; for, as he
was huddling off, he just caught the face of the Princess,
peeping through the opening of a door with some
friends, all almost convulsed with laughter.</p>
